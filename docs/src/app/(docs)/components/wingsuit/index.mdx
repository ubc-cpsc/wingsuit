# Wingsuit Pattern

A Wingsuit pattern is defined inside a `pattern.wingsuit.yml`.

<b>A Wingsuit pattern contains:</b>

* index.js
* pattern.stories.jsx
* pattern.wingsuit.yml
* css file (optional)
* javascript file. (optional)

Expose the reference to the `wingsuit.yml` file inside the `pattern.stories.jsx` file.

```js
const patternDefinition = require('./pattern.wingsuit.yml');

export const wingsuit = {
  patternDefinition,
};

```
### The pattern.wingsuit.yml
The `pattern.wingsuit.yml` is a extended version of the UI Patterns yaml. Check out the [UI Patterns documentation](https://ui-patterns.readthedocs.io/en/8.x-1.x/content/patterns-definition.html), with additions of [UI Patterns Settings](https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns_settings).

A typical pattern definition file looks like this:

```yaml
card:
  use: "@molecules/card/card.twig"
  label: Card
  description: Amazing Cards
  fields:
    headline:
      type: text
      label: Headline
      preview:
        faker: lorem.word
    image:
      type: pattern
      preview:
        id: image
        variant: primary
  variants:
    default:
      label: Default
    horizontal:
      label: Horizontal
  settings:
    headline_color:
      type: select
      label: Headline color
      required: false
      options:
        blue: Blue
        black: Black
```

* Each `variant` is a storybook story.
* Each `field` is editable with knobs and passed to the Twig template.
* Each `setting` is editable with knobs and passed to the Twig template.


## The extensions
To build better preview functionality, Wingsuit adds additional YAML configuration. These extensions are _not_ compatible with UI Patterns Library.


### Type: pattern
With field type `pattern` you can render other patterns inside the pattern:
```yaml
fields:
  image:
    type: pattern
    preview:
      id: image
      variant: primary
      settings:
        style: medium
      fields:
        field: value
```
* `id` The id of the pattern.
* `variant` The variant of the pattern.
* `fields` Overwrites field preview values of the pattern.
* `settings` Overwrites setting preview values of the pattern.

### Pattern list
This works also with a list of patterns.
```yaml
fields:
  images:
    type: pattern
    multi_value_type: single_value
    preview:
      -
        id: image
        variant: primary
        settings:
          style: medium
        fields:
          field: value
      -
        id: image
        variant: primary
        settings:
          style: medium
        fields:
          field: value
```
You can control how Wingsuit will handle the resulting array of objects.

#### Following options are available:
* `single_value`: All patterns will be rendered into a single value. The resulting variable is a string not a array. This useful if you want to add multiple objects into one area.
<br/>Your pattern.twig looks like:
```twig
{{ images }}
```
* `items` provides a list of patterns. The resulting variable is an array you can loop through.
   #### Your pattern.twig looks like:
```twig
{% for item in images %}
{{ item }}
{% endfor %}
```

* `field_items` provides a list of objects. The rendered pattern is inside the content key. This is useful to emulate multi value field templates in drupal.
```twig
{% for item in images %}
{{ item.content }}
{% endfor %}
```
### Composing patterns (Since V1.1):
Composition allows you to embed patterns into patterns.
```yaml
fields:
  container:
    label: Container
    type: pattern
    preview:
      id: container
      fields:
        content:
          - id: rich_text
            fields:
              text: Lorem ipsum
          - id: button
            fields:
              text: Read more
            settings:
              url: https://www.readmore.de

```
### Type object
```yaml
fields:
  items:
    type: object
    preview:
      - title: Datenschutz
        link: "#"
        in_active_trail: true
      - title: Impressum
        link: "#"
```
With field type `object` you can pass any objects to the Twig template. This is useful for the menu, for example. You can edit the JSON string with knobs.

### Visibility
With the visibility property you can control in which app a pattern should be visible. If the property is not set, the pattern is visible in every app.
```yaml
visibility: storybook | drupal | none
```
