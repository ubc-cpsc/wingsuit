After login navigate to [layout builder](http://demo.wingsuit.dev.key-tec.de/en/node/1/layout) and start to build your page.

## Prerequisites
[Wingsuit Kickstarter](https://github.com/wingsuit-designsystem/wingsuit_kickstarter) is the fastest way to start with Wingsuit.
The Kickstarter uses UI Patterns to map Patterns to Drupal and [Acquia Blt](https://github.com/acquia/blt) for automation.

## Installation

### DDEV (recommend)
#### Create project dir
```bash
mkdir project_name
cd project_name
ddev config --project-type=drupal10 --docroot=docroot --create-docroot --database=mariadb:10.11 --php-version=8.3
```
#### Install the project
```bash
ddev composer create wingsuit-designsystem/wingsuit-kickstarter:d11-dev --stability dev --no-interaction
ddev init
```

### Plain PHP
```bash
composer create-project wingsuit-designsystem/wingsuit-kickstarter wingsuit-kickstarter --stability dev --no-interaction
cd wingsuit-kickstarter
composer install

# Import database
drush sql:cli < dump/dump.sql
drush cr
drush cim
```

### First steps
Open the page and login with:

Username: admin<br/>
Password: admin

After login, edit the front page and open the layout builder to add more blocks. Each block is mapped to a pattern (mostly molecules), each section is also a pattern.
Click on `configure` in a section to see all settings you find in storybook.

## Development
The kickstarter installs Wingsuit under `docroot/themes/custom` and generates all templates with `yarn ws build drupal` to
`docroot/themes/custom/wingsuit/dist/app-drupal` (check `blt/blt.yml` to see the build process).

You can run webpack in watch mode with `yarn ws dev drupal`. (If your changes don't appear, you probably forgot to start `yarn ws dev drupal`).

The theme loads css, js and patterns from the `dist` folder, not from `source` folder.

You can configure the path of your dist folder. See [Configuration details](../../configurations/details/index.md) to configure the webpack part. Open "Wingsuit settings" under Configuration in Drupal and adjust the path to the dist folder.

### Storybook
To edit your patterns, start storybook: `yarn ws dev storybook`.

## Module overview
The following modules are used to make Wingsuit patterns available to Drupal:

* [components](https://www.drupal.org/project/components): Registers folders of components defined by your theme or module as Twig namespaces.
* [ui\_patterns](https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns): Does the mapping magic.
* [ui\_patterns\_layout\_builder](https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns_layout_builder): To use UI Patterns with Layout Builder.
* [ui\_patterns_settings](https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns_settings): Make patterns configurable.
* [ui\_patterns_field_formatter](https://www.drupal.org/project/ui_patterns_field_formatters): Map Patterns to fields.
* [wingsuit_companion](https://www.drupal.org/project/wingsuit_companion). Locate templates inside the wingsuit `dist` folder.
